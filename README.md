# SORIDRAW Music Studio

## Development

Use Node.js 20.x. The root `.nvmrc` and `package.json` engine field keep the web app aligned with Firebase Functions.

1. Copy `.env.example` to the environment used by the web build.
2. Register the Firebase web app with App Check and set the public reCAPTCHA Enterprise site key when ready.
3. Install dependencies and start the app.

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Before deployment, verify both the web app and Functions. These commands do not deploy anything.

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
cd functions
npm ci
npm run build
```

## Personal Gemini API key security

- Users register their own Gemini API key from the API settings screen.
- The key is stored in the server-only Firestore document `user_api_keys/{uid}`.
- The browser never receives the key and never calls Gemini directly.
- The authenticated Firebase Function `generateGeminiContent` reads the current key and calls Gemini server-side.
- The proxy sends Gemini credentials with the official `x-goog-api-key` request header and accepts both legacy Standard keys and new authorization keys issued by AI Studio.
- Google states that Standard keys will be rejected starting September 2026, so users should migrate to a new authorization key before then.
- Do not configure `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`; private Gemini keys must never be included in a Vite client build.

See `docs/SORIDRAW_SECURITY_COST_PLAN.md` for App Check activation, server limits, remaining console work, and the staged KMS migration plan.
